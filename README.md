## Warmup

## Git Flow
**Stage, Commit, Push**

**I Do**
(add new file)
```
  - git status (discuss staging)
  - git add <filename>
  - git status (discuss committing)
  - git commit -m "message here"
  - git push origin master
```

**Turn and Talk: What is a local repo vs a remote repo?**
(discuss local vs remote)

**You Do With Me**

- Wire local to talk to remote.

**Work with Partner**
